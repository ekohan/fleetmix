# Final Summary: Per-Vehicle Parameters Refactoring

## Overview

Successfully completed the refactoring to move operational parameters (`avg_speed`, `service_time`, `max_route_time`) from global parameters to per-vehicle specifications. This enables different vehicle types (bikes, trucks, drones) to have different operational characteristics.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. **Data Model Updates** ✅
- Added `avg_speed`, `service_time`, and `max_route_time` as required fields to `VehicleSpec`
- Added the same fields to the public `VehicleConfiguration` type
- Removed these fields from global `Parameters`
- Updated `ClusteringContext` to include these fields

### 2. **Configuration Format Change** ✅
- Changed YAML format to require these parameters per vehicle instead of globally
- Updated all test configurations and default configuration file
- Created migration scripts for existing configurations

### 3. **Code Updates** ✅
- **Cluster Generation**: Updated to use per-vehicle parameters
- **Merge Phase**: Fixed to extract parameters from vehicle configurations
- **GUI**: Updated to show per-vehicle parameter inputs
- **CLI**: Removed global parameter arguments
- **API**: Updated conversion to include per-vehicle parameters
- **Save Results**: Updated to display per-vehicle parameters

### 4. **Test Updates** ✅
- Fixed all failing tests (7 tests were failing initially)
- Fixed all skipped tests (3 tests were skipped)
- Updated test fixtures to include per-vehicle parameters
- All 349 tests now passing

### 5. **Coverage** ✅
- Achieved 82% code coverage (exceeding the 80% target)
- Up from 77% at the start of this session

### 6. **TODOs Resolved** ✅
- Fixed GUI to properly handle per-vehicle parameters
- Fixed clustering generator to calculate average speed from configurations
- Fixed merge phase to get vehicle parameters from configurations
- Fixed VRP solver to use vehicle-specific parameters

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Different vehicle types can have different operational characteristics
2. **Realism**: Better modeling of heterogeneous fleets (e.g., bikes vs trucks)
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add more per-vehicle parameters in the future

## Breaking Changes

This is a v2.0 breaking change that affects:
- Configuration file format (YAML structure)
- Public API (`VehicleConfiguration` type now requires 3 additional fields)
- Internal data structures
- Most core modules that previously used global operational parameters

## Migration Guide

To update existing configurations:

1. Move `avg_speed`, `service_time`, and `max_route_time` from root level to each vehicle:
   ```yaml
   # Old format
   avg_speed: 30.0
   vehicles:
     SmallTruck:
       capacity: 1000
   
   # New format
   vehicles:
     SmallTruck:
       capacity: 1000
       avg_speed: 30.0
       service_time: 25.0
       max_route_time: 10.0
   ```

2. Update any code that accessed `params.avg_speed`, etc. to get values from vehicle specs

3. Use the provided migration script: `python tools/migrate_vehicle_yamls.py`

## Next Steps

The refactoring is complete and ready for use. Future enhancements could include:
- Adding more per-vehicle parameters (e.g., fuel efficiency, emissions)
- Implementing vehicle-specific cost models
- Supporting time-dependent speeds per vehicle type
